// Hello World is the normal thing people start coding with
// This is a Comment - anything after a // is ignored by Java

public class HelloWorld {

  // This is a "main Method"
  // All Java programs start with a "main method" - it literally needs to be called "main"
  // Without this, you can't run anything
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World"); // This will print "Hello World" to the console when you run this
  }

  // Now you can right click on "main"
  // There should be an option "Run HelloWorld.main()`
  // Click on that

  // A "console" should pop up at the bottom with the output:
  /* <somestuff you don't need to read>
  * Hello World
  *
  * Process finished with exit code 0
  */

  // That's it! You just build and ran a Java program. 
}
