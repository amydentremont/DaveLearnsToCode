public class Arrays {

    // this is an array, it's a simple "data structure"
    // an array is basically a list
    // Integers are just whole numbers
    // I've populated the array with the numbers 1-5
    public static final int[] ARRAY_OF_INTEGERS = new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    // (ARRAY_OF_INTEGERS is in all caps because it's static final, we'll get to this later)

    // Make a main method
    // try printing values from the array
    // you can access the array like ARRAY_OF_INTEGERS[0]
    // - this is getting the element in the array at the "index" 0
    // counting in computer science starts from 0, you'll get used to it.
    // So ARRAY_OF_INTEGERS[0] here is 1, ARRAY_OF_INTEGERS[1] here is 2, etc.

    // Now try doing some stuff like printing out adding the numbers, subtracting, etc

    // Now see what methods the class Array has that you can use
    // type ARRAY_OF_INTEGERS and then just .
    // This should come up with a menu of "public" methods you can use -
    // length is the only really interesting one right now
